        <p>This is where I would put my taco collection... <strong>IF I HAD ONE!!!!</strong></p>

        <h2>So whats the point of this page?</h2>
        <p>IDK lol. I guess I'll provide you with some taco tips, or something.</p>
    
        <h3>Things to remember when tacoing.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Your tacos must be made with love.</li>
            <p>And I don't mean the lewd kind.</p>
            <li>There are infinite styles of tacoing. Try a new one now! Right now. RIGHT. NOW.</li>
            <li>Try playing around with various cheeses.</li>
            <p>Tacos usually use cheddar or "Mexican Cheese". 
            Try some real mexican cheese, get that queso up in this bitch. 
            In all seriousness, american cheese are pretty fucking whacked and you'll want to consider trying some alternative that are tastier. 
            Southern american cheeses are a natural fit, but who says you can't be experimental. 
            Just probably want to stay away from weird stuff like goat cheese, but then again I haven't tried that so who knows.</p>
            <li>The actual meat can be more important than you think. Try some brisket. Or a different style of chicken... Or for vegans, try cooking veggies in different styles.</li>
            <p>I seriously think you should try brisket. But hell, there's tons of options, and even just onions being cooked in one way vs another can change
            the entire experience from the ground up.</p>
            <li>Tortillas? Try a few different ones. Those blue ones look cool, try them and let me know if they're good I've been curious.</li>
            <p>No but really, email me if you try those blue ones, I'm curious. They also make red ones from tomatoes and green from spinach. Sounds interesting.</p>
            <li>Wrap that sucker up, and if you want throw that bad larry back on the grill for a little on each side.</li>
            <p>Shoutout to chris for showing me this. Hey, that rhymes.</p>
